#+title: Chinese configuration
** Segmentation 
Sentence segmentation is performed by [[https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/emacs-jieba][emacs-jieba]]. The Emacs package will install the rust dependencies when installed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'jieba)
#+end_src

** Download HSK word lists
You can check if HSK word lists can be found in =paw-hsk-dir=. If they can't be found, then they will be downloaded

=M-x paw-hsk-update-word-lists=

This function will download any necessary files and make the necessary list =paw-hsk-easy-words= that is used to determine which words should be hidden when using =paw-view-note=.

** Sample configuration
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package paw
    :straight (:local-repo "~/code/elisp/paw")
    :init (require 'paw-hsk)
    (require 'paw-jieba)
    (paw-hsk-update-word-lists)
    :custom
    (paw-non-ascii-word-separator "‚Å£") ;; Invisible separator character
    (paw-non-ascii-language "zh")

    (paw-go-translate-langs '(en zh))

    (paw-offline-studylist '(("Chinese Studylist" ;; studylist name when choosing offline studylist
			      (id . "1") ;; random id for internal use, but it could not be the same as any id in online study list defined in `paw-studylist'
			      (language . "zh") ;; language of the studylist
			      (name . "Chinese")) ;; name of the studylist
			     ))

    (paw-search-function #'paw-chinese-search-function)

** Use Org CC-Cedict dictionary
[[https://github.com/jiewawa/org-cc-cedict][Org CC-CEDICT]] is a special sdcv dictionary designed to take advantage of Org-Mode Features.

It restyles CC-CEDICT dictionary entries and uses custom Org-Mode links to display characters with highlighting based on its tone,
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/jiewawa/org-cc-cedict.git
  cd org-cc-cedict
  python main.py PATH-TO-CC-CEDICT-FILE
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq paw-view-note-meaning-src-lang "org")
  (setq paw-sdcv-dictionary-list '("Org CC-Cedict"))
#+end_src
