Study for a life in Emacs.

~paw.el~ was created in 2021 as an annotation tool, but I was not used it a lot at that time. Recently I picked it up and dramatically changed its usage. Now it is a complete solution of making annotations and language learning tools, right inside Emacs. 

paw relies on sqlite. All annotations are saved inside a database, which means it can be easily backup and you can read and make annotation right inside Emacs (PC/mobile) using same database. 

paw's ideas are coming from all following great tools:
1. LingQ: Learning a language by reading
2. Kindle Vocabulary Builder
3. org noter
4. Chatgpt
5. SDCV
6. go-translate
7. Eudic
8. 蒙哥阅读器
and more.

This package is mainly used along with:
1. nov-mode
2. org-mode
3. eaf-mode
4. pdf-view-mode

But it is able to work with all modes (defined in ~paw-annotation-mode-supported-modes~) in Emacs.

I'll update the doc in the future, there are too much to cover. But I'll show you the most useful cases first:

* Reading and annotation
1. Open an epub file using nov.el or an org file
2. Enable ~paw-annotation-mode~ (buffer will be turned into read-only if
   ~paw-annotation-read-only-enable~ is t to avoid accidental alternation)
3. Use paw.el add word/highlight/bookmark/todo/, for example, ~paw-add-word~,
   ~paw-add-highlight~... Please check M-x ~paw-add-*~ related commands for all
   type of supported annotations.
4. Annotations will be highlighted via overlay. Under the annotation, you
   can do various of operations. For example, to edit the annotation, under the
   annotation, press ~i~, ~paw-find-note~. It will create an org file under
   ~paw-note-dir~ dedicated for this annotation, save by C-c C-c, changes will be
   saved in the database as well.
6. Call ~paw~ to manage all annotations.

* Language Learning
1. Copy a text you want to learn to an org file.
2. Enable ~paw-annotation-mode~
3. Use ~paw-add-online-word~ to add a new word. (currently only support Eudic,
   apply Authorization key on https://my.eudic.net/OpenAPI/Authorization, and
   fill it into ~paw-authorization-keys~ before adding online words)) All online
   words will be highlighted on any buffers that were enabled
   ~paw-annoation-mode.~
3. Under any annotation, use ~paw-view-note~, it will show you an analysis buffer
   of the annotation. It has dictionary, translation, notes and also able
   to search by external browser.
4. Use ~paw-view-note-current-thing~, ~paw-view-note-next-thing~, ~paw-view-note-prev-thing~, it will do segmentation using [[https://github.com/ikawaha/kagome][kagome]]
   (Japanese), and [[https://github.com/skywind3000/ECDICT][ECDICT]] (English).
5. Check https://www.lingq.com/en/, you know more ideas how to learn a foreign
   language with ~paw.el~.


Not only above, it will has many other features, such as focus mode support, and
more!
